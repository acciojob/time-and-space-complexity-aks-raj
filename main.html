	  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time Complexity and efficient </p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b>,on the other hand, deals with the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses to solve a problem with respect to the input size. An algorithm's space complexity is often denoted by <b>Space Complexity</b> and is represented by Big O notation, such as O(n), where n is the input size. It signifies that the algorithm's memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
