  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  
  <p>When we analyze algorithms, one crucial aspect we consider is their <strong>time complexity</strong>. Time complexity refers to how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. In simpler terms, it tells us how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time. An efficient algorithm typically has a lower time complexity, which means it can handle larger inputs without causing excessive delays.</p>
  
  <p>On the other hand, <strong>space complexity</strong> deals with the amount of memory an algorithm uses to solve a problem. It's important to note that memory usage can vary depending on the programming language and environment. Space complexity is often expressed using big O notation, such as <strong>O(n)</strong>, where <strong>n</strong> represents the size of the input. This indicates how the memory usage increases as the input size grows.</p>
