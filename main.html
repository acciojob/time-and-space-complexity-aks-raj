<<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in algorithm analysis. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute. An algorithm with better time complexity performs fewer operations and completes faster. This is particularly important when dealing with large input sizes, as efficient algorithms ensure timely results.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses while executing. It is essential to manage memory efficiently to optimize an algorithm's performance. One common way to measure space complexity is using the notation <b>O(n)</b>, where 'n' represents the size of the input data. This notation helps us understand how an algorithm's memory usage scales as the input size increases, allowing us to design algorithms that are both time and space efficient.</p></body>
