	  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms aim to have low time complexity, ensuring that their execution completes quickly even for large inputs.

       <b> Space complexity</b>, on the other hand, deals with the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses to solve a problem with respect to the input size. An algorithm's space complexity is often denoted by <b>Space Complexity</b> and is represented by Big O notation, such as <b>O(n)</b>, where <i>n</i> is the input size. It signifies that the algorithm's memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
